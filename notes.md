Classic American Road trips
-say hello
-display all road trips (11)
-ask user to select one (by number) that they'd like to learn more about
-display road trip details including:
  1. description
  2. highlights along route
-then ask user, want more info?
  if yes, display further info: related guidebook
  if no, ask user if they'd like to choose another route
    -if yes, display all road trips again
    -if no say thank you for visiting and exit
