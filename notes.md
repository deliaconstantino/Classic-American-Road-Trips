Classic American Road trips
-say hello
-display all road trips (11)
-ask user to select one (by number) that they'd like to learn more about
-display road trip details including:
  1. description
  2. highlights along route
  3. related guidebook
-then ask user, want more info?
  if yes, display further info
  if no, ask user if they'd like to choose another route
    -if yes, display all road trips again
    -if no say thank you for visiting and exit


classes needed:
1. route-knows info about route including: name, number?, route highlights, info blurb
2. CLI: interacts for user and app, gets selection and outputs
3. state? maybe cli can find routes that go through certain states?
